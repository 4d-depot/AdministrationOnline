# 4D Administration Online

Welcome to the 4D Administration Online component project!

This 4D project is intended to be built as a 4D Component and embedded into 4D Servers applications.
By default the component starts its own http server on port 8888, but you are free to define your own settings.
Using these default settings, the web interface is accessible on the url:  http://{ip}:8888/admin/ini.
Feel free to clone, fork and modify the project!
